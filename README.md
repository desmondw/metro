This is a game I developed for the 48 hour game competition Ludum Dare 26. The theme was minimalism and I tried to capture the simple aesthetic of flat design and abstract music. Short, sweet, and simple. This was one of my first Gamemaker projects and I learned a lot about the suitability of the engine in the process.
